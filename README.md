## Description
I recreated the classic game of Space Invaders complete with multiple enemies, the ability to shoot those enemies and have them respawn, and a Game Over text when they get too close to the player. I have multiple images in my folder for the enemy, player, bullet, and background of the game. Areas of improvement could be using classes for the enemies, have a scoring system, and adding music and sound strikes to make the game more interesting.
